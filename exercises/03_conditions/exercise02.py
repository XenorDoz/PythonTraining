# First, ask for the price
# You can almost copy the exercise01.py file!
# Also, don't bother with "USD", simply ask the price without the unit

answer = 

# Then, convert it into a number

number = 

# Now, apply the correct reduction using the correct block!
# You must decide how to structure your conditions so that:
"""
If price is above or equal to 100, apply a reduction of 10 %
Otherwise, if price is above or equal to 50, apply a reduction of 5
Otherwise, if price is above or equal to 20, apply a reduction of 1

*Hint: Apply a reduction of 10% is the same as multiplying by 0.90!*
"""
# Think carefully: depending on how you write your conditions,
# the result may change!






# Finally, display it!
