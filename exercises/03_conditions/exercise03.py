# You're on your own now!
# Ask a number, and display:
# - if it's even
# - if it's greater than 10
# - or if it's both at the same time!
# - if none of the above condition match, say it's a special case.
#
# If it's both, display it in only one print().
# This means you will need to use the `and` keyword!

# The modulo operator (%) exactly gives you that!
# For example: 8 % 2 gives 0, 9 % 2 gives 1
