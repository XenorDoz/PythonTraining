# You are given the following dictionary

temps = {
    (0, 0): 12,
    (0, 1): 14,
    (1, 0): 15
}

# Display the temperature at position `(0, 1)`





# Add a new temperature at position `(1, 1)` with the value `18`




# Replace the temperature at position `(0,0)` with `10`




# Display all the keys from the dictionary (hint: use `temps.keys()`)






"""
I added a way to display only the keys, not the whole things in the solutions
When you're done and your terminal looks like the output file, check it!
It is not mandatory at all, it is only to make it appear clean in the terminal!
If you want to use the keys, you absolutely have to leave it raw
