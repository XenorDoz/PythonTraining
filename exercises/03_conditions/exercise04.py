# Let's make a small game!
# The program secretly chooses a number (you can pick any number you want).
# Then, ask the user to guess it.
#
# Depending on the guess, display:
# - "Too low!" if the guess is smaller
# - "Too high!" if the guess is greater
# - "Correct!" if it's exactly the same
#
# For now, you only have one try — we'll fix that later!

secret =     # Choose your secret number here
guess =      # Ask the user for their guess
