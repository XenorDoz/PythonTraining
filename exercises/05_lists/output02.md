This is what your terminal should look like:  
```bash
Default state of drinks:
        ['coffee', 'tea', 'water']
Changed "tea" to "juice":
        ['coffee', 'juice', 'water']
Added "milk" at the end of the list:
        ['coffee', 'juice', 'water', 'milk']
Removed coffee:
        ['juice', 'water', 'milk']
water
Removed the value at index 1:
        ['juice', 'milk']
```
