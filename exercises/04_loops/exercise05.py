# Ask for the number `a`





# Ask for the number `b`





# Display every number from `a` to `b` included using a while loop
# Hint: you might want a variable that keeps track of where you are in the loop

position = a # You can use this variable as your starting point





# Now backwards! (from b to a, included)
